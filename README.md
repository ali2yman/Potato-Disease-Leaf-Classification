# Potato-Disease-Leaf-Classification
This project focuses on detecting potato leaf diseases (Early Blight, Late Blight) and distinguishing them from Healthy leaves using Deep Learning and Transfer Learning techniques.  We use the Potato Leaf Disease (PLD) dataset, apply proper preprocessing, and a powerful model based on EfficientNetB0 architecture.
